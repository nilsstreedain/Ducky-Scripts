### macOS Ducky Scripts
This is a collection of Ducky Script payloads I have written for the Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky that specifically target macOS computers. I have included both the payload.txt as well as the inject.bin for each script.

## List of Scripts:
Name: | Description: | Download:
--- | --- | ---
[rickroll](/rickroll) | Opens a rickroll in YouTube in full screen at maximum volume. | [payload.txt](/rickroll/payload.txt) [inject.bin](/rickroll/inject.bin)
[rickrollPayload](/rickrollPayload) | Opens a rickroll in YouTube in full screen at maximum volume as a distraction while another command is run in terminal. | [payload.txt](/rickrollPayload/payload.txt) [inject.bin](/rickrollPayload/inject.bin)
